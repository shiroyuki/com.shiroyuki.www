Gallium - A Microframework for CLI Development
##############################################

:Language: Python 3.4+ (kinda supporting Python 2.7)
:Tested: Python 3.4 - 3.5, DEV

Gallium Framework is designed to eliminate the need of setting up bootstrap and allow fast-pace CLI development where it only relies on built-in libraries such as ArgumentParser to let the developers define the argument in the way commonly known to any Python developers without asking them to learn new things.

So, the user can use run ``g3 <sub-command> [...]`` where the subcommands
are imported and defined in cli.json from the current working directory.

You can...

* Install via ``pip`` (recommended to use Python 3/``pip3``).
* `Download the source code from GitHub <https://github.com/shiroyuki/gallium>`_
* `Check out the readme file <https://github.com/shiroyuki/gallium/blob/master/README.md>`_

.. * `Check out the manual <http://passerine-orm.readthedocs.org/>`_
