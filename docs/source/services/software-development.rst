Web/Software Development
########################

As I am tied up with my full-time job with `Statflo`, open-source projects, and
personal projects, I am only available for consulting.


See what else I offer from the menu on the top-right corner or :doc:`/projects/index`.

Contact Guideline
=================

As unscheduled phone calls are very distracting, especially during the work and
after hours (when I spend time with opensource projects and family), from **Year 2016**
and onward, I'm abiding the following rules of engagement based on the type of contacts.

Personal and/or Open-source Projects
------------------------------------

Please contact me via `Twitter <https://twitter.com/shiroyuki>`_.

If you know my **Facebook**, **Hangouts**, **Line**, or **Skype**,
please try these channels first.

Recruitments
------------

Please contact via **LinkedIn** only.

.. note::

    1. Any engagements via LinkedIn or any social networks
       **without prior directly connection**, AKA being "friends", may be ignored.
    2. Unscheduled and unconfirmed phone calls may be ignored. 
    3. Sending e-mail directly is a no-go unless I provide to you directly.
    4. I'm currently not interested in any new or exciting opportunities, as I
       already have my own excitement and fun at Statflo, at least until **December 2017**.
       You can try but please note that this means high probability (99.99%) that your
       offer will be turned down politely.

This guideline is written in order to reduce distraction and save you ("recruiters")
from wasting time. Your cooperation and consideration are much appreciated.
