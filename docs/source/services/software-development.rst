Web/Software Development
########################

As I am tied up with my full-time job with `Statflo`, open-source projects, and
personal projects, I am only available for consulting.


See what else I offer from the menu on the top-right corner or :doc:`/projects/index`.

Contact Guideline
=================

As unscheduled phone calls are very distracting, especially during the work and
after hours (when I spend time with opensource projects and family), from **Year 2016**
and onward, I'm abiding the following rules of engagement based on the type of contacts.

Personal and/or Open-source Projects
------------------------------------

Please contact me via `Twitter <https://twitter.com/shiroyuki>`_.

If you know my **Facebook**, **Hangouts**, **Line**, **Skype**, or **Facetime**
please try these channels first.

Consultancy
-----------

Please contact via either phone or e-mail between 11AM and 5PM Eastern
(Standard/Daylight-saving) Time.

Recruitments
------------

Please contact via **LinkedIn** only.

Here is my rule of engagement.

.. warning::

    I will say "No" to whoever break one of these rules. Make good choice.

1. Any engagements via LinkedIn or any social networks **without prior directly
   connections**, AKA being "friends", may be ignored.
2. Absolutely **no unscheduled and unconfirmed phone calls or audio chat**.
3. Sending e-mail directly is a **no-go** unless I provide to you directly.

:"No" reply probability: 100%

This guideline is written in order to reduce distraction and save you ("recruiters")
from wasting time. Your cooperation and consideration are much appreciated. Your
being uncooperative is not welcome.
