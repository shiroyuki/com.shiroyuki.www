Rediscovery Tokyo (Part 1)
##########################

Due to unforeseen circumstance in 2013, I wasn’t unable to go to Tokyo for
PyCon APAC 2013. Since then, I’ve decided to prepare for PyCon in Montréal
and Tokyo in 2014. Luckily, my talk proposal was accepted for Tokyo and
therefore, my longest trip to Japan has begun.

==================

It is the first time that my flight leaves in the afternoon. As the arrival
time is the same as before, I wonder why my previous flights which leave in
the morning still arrived at the same time.

Nevertheless, I got more than enough sleep and managed to finish the
preparation for my talk before boarding the plane.

As soon as I arrived, I went straight to the hotel and had a dinner my friend
afterward. Despite of my friend's concern over my jetlag, I went to Ueno and
then got lost for a few minutes in the end.
