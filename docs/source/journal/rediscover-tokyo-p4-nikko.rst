Rediscover Tokyo - Part 4 - Nikko
#################################

Nikko, short for `Nikko National Park <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikk%C5%8D_National_Park>`_, is not exactly in Tokyo but it is a change of pace.

(09.15) Although the national park covers four prefectures, Patara and I only
went to the one in Tochigi for a day trip.

We caught a morning express train around 8 AM to Nikko from Ikebukuro station.
With a little drama from my unusual bad memory with the ticket, things went
pretty smoothly.

As we only had less than 4 hours before the last express train to Tokyo leaves
Nikko, we skipped the shrine entirely and went straight to the hiking trail.
Our intended route is from `Ryuzu Falls (竜頭の滝) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%ABzu_Falls>`_ to Yuno Lake. However as I
made too many stops for landscape shots, we only reached Yudaki Falls (湯滝)
where is a shy kilometer away from Yuno Lake.

If I have chance to re-visit the country side of Japan, I would rent a car and
aimlessly document old, abandoned houses or cities en route. It makes me feel
sad to see the places are dying.

For the whole trail, I took 94 videos and more than 690 photos and used all
32GB memory cards and all batteries for all cameras.
