Rediscover Tokyo - Part 2
#########################

As I finished the presentation earlier than I expected, I had one full day
to explore Tokyo on foot.

September 12, 2014
==================

My journey started from my hotel in Shinjuku as early as 8 o'clock. Although
I set Tokyo Station as my final destination, I did not expect to finish the
course as I had the plan with my friend around 11 o'clock.

Instead of drawing the path, I simply went with the compass. As it turned
out, it became more interesting as it showed the real Tokyo.
