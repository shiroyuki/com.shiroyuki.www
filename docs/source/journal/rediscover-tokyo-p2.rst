Rediscovery Tokyo (Part 2)
##########################

As I finished the presentation earlier than I expected, I had one full day
to explore Tokyo on foot.

September 12, 2014
==================

My journey started from my hotel in Shinjuku as early as 8 o'clock. Although
I set Tokyo Station as my final destination, I did not expect to finish the
course as I had the plan with my friend around 11 o'clock.

Instead of drawing the path, I simply went with the compass. As it turned
out, it became more interesting as it showed the real Tokyo.

:Configuration: Nikon D810, Nikkor 50mm f/1.8G, Nikkor 24-70mm f/2.8G and Fujifilm X100S
