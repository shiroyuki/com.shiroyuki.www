Rediscover Tokyo - Part 5 - Kawagoe
###################################

Kawagoe, is also not in Tokyo but Saitama.

(09.16) After hiking a crazy 6-kilometer trail in 3 hours, many people would
lay low and gently live the day. I did not do that unfortunately.

In the morning, I met up with Chika and we took an express train to Kawagoe.

I use the street-photography style for this trip. So, I left all gears back
at Patara's apartment in order to travel light.

Kawagoe is a lovely town and exhibits the atmosphere of the ancient architecture,
which you may easily find in Nara, and a post-war architecture, which is built
between 1960s - 1980s. My goal was to explore an ancient town and buy sweets from
a local sweet shop.

Nevertheless, the extreme heat threw us off a bit and so we spent lots of time
on resting.

After wandering for more than five hours in Kawagoe, we decided to chill down
with a short visit to Tokyo Observation Town in Roppongi for a night landscape
shot. We also accidentally had time to visit a barbie exhibition. I won't
recommend my aunt though.

After that we went for a bowl of ramen in the area before calling for the day.

There were a couple things that I have experienced for the first time from the
trip to Kawagoe.

Earthquake (minor) and an earthquake alert via mobile network
=============================================================

The earthquake which was originated from 24 km NE of Saitama and 1 km SE of
Sakai at 1228h happened to be minor. Having said that, I received a few messages
checking if I was okay as soon as the earthquake occured.

What was interesting was the alert sent to Chika's. I first thought it was
a weird ringtone but later She told me it was an earthquake alert. It is
very interesting to see how it works in action. Nevertheless, the alert arrived
just a few seconds before the earthquake. It shows a little promise of advanced
warning unfortunately but it is good enough in case of the evacuation is needed.

High-school Baseball Match (高校野球試合)
===================================

As we got lost in the middle of the trip (thank to me), we accidentally had
chance to see a local high-school-level baseball match. The match ended with
the home team having gotten a shut-out game at 0-1.

The cheering squad was pretty small yet powerful from both sides. Enough to
shake the small stadium.

I also saw a number of serious observers and scouts behind the catcher. How
serious? These guys equipped with video recoders and speed guns.
