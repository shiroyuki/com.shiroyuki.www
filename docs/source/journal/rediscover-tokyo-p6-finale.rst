Rediscover Tokyo - Part 6 - Finale
##################################

As everyone was busy, I spent my last three days of my trip by myself.

As I was by myself, I simply strolled around Nippori, Yanaka, Nezu, Akihabara
and Asakusa at my own pace.

Although I love to use Nikon D810, my allergy became too severe to carry the
Nikon set. On the last two days of my trip, I was forced to use Fujifilm X100S,
which made people almost completely ignore the existance of the camera.

I was glad to be in Tokyo again in 2014. I got to meet lots of new and old
friends. I happened to have chance to capture and document the very moments of
lives in Japan. The videos and photographs are surprisingly very good. They are
so good that I consider submitting a few of my best photographs to a few place
like National Geographic Photo Contest 2014 and Nikon Photo Contest 2014-2015.

Have I mentioned about food so far? The food in Japan is so good. Even the bad
one is still way better and cheaper than what I usually find.

Nevertheless, my trip would be boring if I did not have help from Patara, Chika,
friends I met at PyCon, a missionary (who interrupted my journey to find breakfast)
and cats.

Where should I do the next (re)discovery series? Only my next vacation can tell.

    This was not a medical emergency. Just a drunk young lady refused to be
    pulled up by her friends.
