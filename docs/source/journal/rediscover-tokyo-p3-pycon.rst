Rediscover Tokyo - Part 3 - PyCon JP
####################################

It is funny that I enjoy the conference even though I hardly remember what happens.

Thank to the fact that I finished preparation for my talk on the 14th in early morning,
my tension became low enough so that I had more time for conversation, catching up with
friends and solo urban exploration. The areas I went are:

- Tsukiji Market (Morning)
- A small part of Ginza (Morning)
- Shimbashi Station (Morning)
- Odaiba (Daytime)
- Shinjuku (Nighttime)
