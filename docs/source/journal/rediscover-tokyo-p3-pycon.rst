Rediscover Tokyo - Part 3 - PyCon JP
####################################

It is funny that I enjoy the conference even though I hardly remember what happens.

Thank to the fact that I finished preparation for my talk on 14 early,
my tension became low enough so that I had more time for conversation,
catching up with friends and solo urban exploration. The area I went
are:

- Tsukiji Market (Morning)
- A small part of Ginza (Morning)
- Shimbashi Station (Morning)
- Odaiba (Daytime)
- Shinjuku (Nighttime)

    Taken at 5 AM. Maybe Japanese people should take more vacation.

    Tsukiji Market was too busy that the traffic could have been too dangerous for visitors.
