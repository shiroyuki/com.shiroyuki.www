Policies and Ethics on Photography
##################################

This page refers to policies and ethics defined for all photographic works done
by Juti Noppornpitak and his associates.

.. note::

    This page may be updated without notices.

1. All photographs taken in the public areas will be released without release
   forms and strictly available for editorials.
2. The service is often free and I try not to accept any kinds of monetary payments,
   except via Flickr, 500px and Getty. However, if you really appreciate my work,
   please donate to your local Red Cross or hospitals.
3. The employer must include all of my work-related expense, period.

.. note::

    The expense coverage will not be requested when I also attend an event as an
    attendee, a guest, a visitor, a speaker etc.

The rest of my policy is aligned in the same manner as other professional photographers.
